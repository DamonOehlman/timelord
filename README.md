# timelord

Timespan (or duration) parser for JS, primarily built to work with the ISO8601 timespan format.  At this stage it's use is primarily around parsing durations associated with (geospatial) route instructions so no logic has been implemented for parsing beyond the period of a week.

For example usage, I would recommend having a look at the tests.
